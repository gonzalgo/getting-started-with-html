<p><b>PART 1: Technological Empathy</b> - the ability to understand what happens when you open or create a web page.
  <br>
- basic understanding of how the internet works
<br>
- understanding of how users, computers, servers, HTTP, and the internet fit together
<br>
</p>
<p><b>PART 2: HTML Tags to create a simple HTML document</b>
  <br></p>
<p><em><b>The Basics of the Web</b></em>
  <br>
  There are 5 basic components to understand about the web:<br>
<p>1.  The <b>World Wide Web - WWW</b> - HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) or hyperlinks that connect the web; invented in the early 1990's.
    <br>
    Major pieces of the web include: You, your computer/browser, the internet, and servers
    <br>
  <br>
    <b>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</b> - made up of:
    <br>
    - text content = what you see<br>
    - mark up = what it looks like<br>
    - references to other documents (e.g videos and images like this one <img src="http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png" alt="hipmunk">)<br>
    - links to other pages<br>
  <br>
  <em>There are a variety of tags that can be associated with HTML markup - collectively called "elements"</em>
  <br>
  <b>b = bold</b>
  <br>
  <em>em = italicize</em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>There are also a variety of attributes that can be added to HTML markup to further enhance the capability of a webpage</em>
  <br>
  The <b>"a href" tag</b> is used to link other webpages to yours.  It can be used to link sites like <a href="www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> or <a href="www.cnn.com">CNN</a>.
  <br>
  Images can also be added using the <b>"img" tag</b>.

  <br>
  Note: the use of img tags do not require a closing tag
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>You can also use Google as a resource to add links in HTML since it's impossible to remember everything!</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  The use and understanding of <b>whitespace</b> is important - it allows you to place text on multiple lines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two types of elements to understand are <b>INLINE and BLOCK</b> elements:
  <br>
  - Examples of <b>INLINE</b> elements include the use of the following tags: b, em, img, br, and span
  <br>
  - Examples of <b>BLOCK</b> elements include the use of the following tags: p, and div
  <br>
  <br>
  **<b>INLINE</b> tags behave differently from <b>BLOCK</b> tags; <b>BLOCK</b> elements can add height and width to a web page
  <br>
  <br>
  <b><em>SUMMARY:</b></em>
  <br>
  - Overview of the Internet - servers, browsers, the Internet, HTTP
  <br>
  - Intro to HTML - tags, inline vs. block
  <br>
  <br>
  1.  What a web page is - a text document written in HTML; web browsers read them then intrepret and display them
  <br>
  2.  How coding works - coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand
  <br>
  3.  Computers are <em>stupid</em> - programmers need to write <em><b>exactly</b></em> the way a computer understands (writing with the correct syntax)
  <br>
  4.  Programmers can't remember everything - just look up what you can't remember - use Google!
  <br>
  5.  Understand basic HTML vocabulary
  <br>
  <br>
  <em><b>Tags</b></em>
  <br>
  - HTML tag is contained within angled brackets
  <br>
  - most tags have an opening and closing tag<br>
  - some tags are void or do not require a closing tag - i.e. the "br" tag
  <br>
  <br>
  <em><b>Element</b></em>
  <br>
  - An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags
  <br>
  <br>
  <em><b>Attribute</b></em>
  <br>
  - This is a property of an HTML element.  i.e. - to set the HREF attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL you would write <em>a href="www.udacity.com"</em>
  <br>
  <br>
  We will be learning more about document structure in the next lesson.
